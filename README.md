--INTRODUCTION--

Data analysts frequently transform data within a database so that it can be used for analysis and so that the data will be easier for nontechnical users to use and understand. You will emulate such a process in this task by choosing your own business question to analyze, creating tables and queries to use as a business report, and streamlining your analysis by writing your own SQL functions, triggers, and stored procedures.

This task defines a report as a collection of data that answers a real-world business question. Your report will have two distinct sections (SQL tables that you will create) that differ in the granularity of the data they present and how directly they support the answering of the business question you choose. The detailed table should contain all data that informs the answer to the question at a very granular level, and the summary table should contain aggregated data that provide a direct answer to the business question.
